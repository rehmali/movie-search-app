# 🎬 Movie Search App

A simple web application that allows users to search for movies using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). It displays movie details such as the title, poster, genre, plot, director, writer, actors, and IMDb rating. Users can also save movies for later viewing using **localStorage**.
